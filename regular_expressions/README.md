# Regular Expressions

This folder contains my solutions to the **Regular Expressions** project, which is part of the ALU Software Engineering curriculum.

## üìå Project Overview

In this project, I worked with **Ruby** and used **regular expressions** to perform pattern matching and string processing. All regex patterns are compatible with the **Oniguruma** regex engine, which Ruby uses by default.

Each Ruby script:

- Uses `.scan` to apply regex to input strings
- Accepts input from the command line
- Prints only the parts that match the specified patterns
