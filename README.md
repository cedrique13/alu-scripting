# Regular Expressions Project

This repository contains my solutions to the **Regular Expressions** project assigned as part of the ALU Software Engineering program.

## 📚 About the Project

The goal of this project is to get comfortable working with **regular expressions** (regex), using the **Oniguruma** regex library (used by Ruby). I wrote several Ruby scripts to practice pattern matching, repetition tokens, and real-world text parsing.

## 🛠️ What I Did

Each task consists of writing a Ruby script that:

- Accepts a string as an argument
- Applies a regular expression using `.scan`
- Prints out matches based on specific patterns

I also explored regex concepts like:

- Literal string matching
- Quantifiers and repetition (`*`, `+`, `{}` etc.)
- Character sets
- Anchors (`^`, `$`)
- Grouping and alternatives (`()`, `|`)
- Extracting structured data from logs

## 🧪 How to Run

You can run each script from the terminal like this:

```bash
./<script_name>.rb "<input_string>"
```
